# YooHoo Answers

This app was born in honor of the late Yahoo! Answers. Currently, it exists as a message board where users can ask and answer whatever questions they may have on their mind.
This is the repository for the back-end API.

# Set-up

After pulling the code down to your client, run a quick npm install, then run a node run server to open the development version on your localhost.

# Tech used

This was built using React, Bootstrap, Axios, and Node.js

# User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to sign up/in/out
- As a user, I want to be able to change my password
- As a user, I want to be able to ask a question
- As a user I want to be able to see all questions asked
- As a user I want to be able to edit/delete questions I've asked
- As a user, I want to be able to see a specific question

# To be implemented in later versions

This is the first version of the app, so currently the only route set-ups are for the questions themselves. As I continue to develop the application, the answer functionality will be implemented, as well as sorting methods for questions (via categories for questions asked)
